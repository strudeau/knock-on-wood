Fast, easy, reliable, I bough all three Kreg Jig^\u0026#174; Drill Guide Blocks (standard, Micro-Pocket^tm, HD) that can fit in the Portable Base adapter. I though about buying a K4 Kreg Jig^\u0026#174; but decided against because that was just one too many things to purchase for a \"small project\". Turns out that the different drill guide blocks don\u0026#8217;t come with clear instructions when it comes to setting the drill bit collar depth. Good thing I had purchased a Kreg^\u0026#174; Easy-Set Pocket-Hole Drill Bit which does contain marking on the drill bit itself as to where to set the collar depth for three wood thickness, \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), \\(1\\frac{1}{2}\\). But what about the other wood thickness, did I ask myself? Also, in all the instructions manuals I read, they were all assuming you would be joining pieces of wood of equal thickness. What about if I want to join a \\(1\\) inch board with a [\\frac{1}{2}] inch one (fictional use case)? I couldn\u0026#8217;t find anywhere clear guiding instructions on how to set the drill bit for that use case. So I ended up modelling my use case using Autodesk^\u0026#174; Fusion 360^TM to try to derive a mathematical model.\n Mathematical Model Using the Kreg^\u0026#174; Easy-Set Pocket-Hole Drill Bit I could find with reasonnable accuracy the setting for drill bit collar depth for:\n Table 1. Drill Bit Collar Depth in Inches as a function of Input Wood Thickness     Wood Thickness A inches.
